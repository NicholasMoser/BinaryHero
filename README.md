# Binary Hero

Go on an adventure in your computer's file system!

## What is this game?

In this game you navigate through your computer's file system and encounter items and
battles based on the files you encounter. Each file has a unique set of encounters it may
yield, ultimately decided by a dice roll. This game is heavily inspired by
[Sonic 3 & Knuckles Lock-On Technology](https://segaretro.org/Lock-On_Technology), which
let you plug in any Sega Genesis game and get a unique [Blue Sphere](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Sphere)
stage. It was further inspired by games like [AudioSurf](https://www.audio-surf.com/) which
generate a unique level based on the music track.

The main objective is to become as strong as possible and accumulate as much gold as possible.

Doors are folders that lead to new encounters. Locked doors are files and folders that are
inaccessible by the game. Papyrus is a non-combat scenario. Swords are combat.

Many file types are recognized by Binary Hero, and the characteristics of the possible encounters
will be tailored to the characteristics of the file. For example, particularly large image
files will yield harder encounters with greater prizes. Every player of this game should
have an experience unique to their computer!

## How to Play

The idea of the game is that there are many paths in your file system you can explore. Users may
also create their own groups of files to create unique repeatable dungeons that others can play.
New file types and more advanced RPG mechanics would be added over time.

The end-game can be found in your Windows folder (e.g. C:/Windows). Encounters in this folder
will be **much** harder and harsher.

## Ideas

- Maybe randomize the order of the icons and don't show the file. That way there is randomness
  to selecting the next encounter?
- Use gold for something?
