# Binary Hero

Go on an adventure in your computer's file system!

## What is this game?

In this game you navigate through your computer's file system and encounter items and
battles based on the files you encounter. Each file has a unique set of encounters it may
yield, ultimately decided by a dice roll. This game is heavily inspired by
[Sonic 3 & Knuckles Lock-On Technology](https://segaretro.org/Lock-On_Technology), which
let you plug in any Sega Genesis game and get a unique [Blue Sphere](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Sphere)
stage. It was further inspired by games like [AudioSurf](https://www.audio-surf.com/) which
generate a unique level based on the music track.

Many file types are recognized by Binary Hero, and the characteristics of the possible encounters
will be tailored to the characteristics of the file. For example, particularly large image
files will yield harder encounters with greater prizes.
